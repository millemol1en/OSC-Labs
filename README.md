# OSC-Labs
These are a collection of the all the labs which I have completed for the university course "Operating Systems and C" from IT University in Copenhagen. These lab assignments are from the book "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective", all of which can be found on the books official website "https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html".

## Labs:
### 1. binlab:
#### Attack Lab:


#### Bomb Lab:
##### Description:
The bomb lab involves deciphering a 6-phase bomb, wherein each phase expects a string as input. If the incorrect input is given, the bomb explodes and the program terminates. To determine the correct string input, one has to navigate through the compiled assembly to determine the string required to diffuse each step in the bomb.
